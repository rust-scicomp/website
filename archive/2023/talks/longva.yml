title: "Superpowering simulators with Rust and dynamecs"
abstract:
  - "Physics simulators for time-dependent problems are hard to compose, and so most researchers develop their own problem-specific ad-hoc software architecture that is often hard to adapt to changing requirements. Consequently, features like configuration file formats, logging and checkpointing must be re-implemented or adapted for every new project, or abandoned altogether."
  - "In this talk, we will see how to use the experimental Rust framework [dynamecs](https://crates.io/crates/dynamecs) to rapidly build prototype simulators that, from the first line of code, automatically support custom per-scenario configuration, checkpointing through [serde](https://serde.rs/) serialization of the simulation state, advanced logging features built-upon [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/), as well as extraction of logged data and performance profiling with tools provided alongside dynamecs."
