title: "Automatic differentiation of Rust, with the friendly help of your compiler"
abstract: "Calculating gradients is necessary for various algorithms such as back propagation, Bayesian inference, uncertainty quantification, and probabilistic programming. Enzyme is a tool that can automatically compute gradients and was accepted for experimental (nightly) integration into the Rust compiler. We demonstrate how [rust-enzyme](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/rust) can be used, present the next development steps, and discuss Rust specific challenges for automatic differentiation."
