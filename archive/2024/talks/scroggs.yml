title: "Writing a grid library for finite and boundary element methods"
abstract:
  - "In the last few years, we've been working on rewriting our boundary element method library [Bempp](https://bempp.com) in Rust ([Bempp-rs](https://github.com/bempp/bempp-rs)). Recently, we've been undertaking some work to spin the grid management out from Bempp-rs into its own library, and generalise it so that it can be used for other methods based on grids. In this talk, I will present some details and highlights of our grid implementation."
