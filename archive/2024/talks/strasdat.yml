abstract:
  - "sophus-rs is a Rust library for 2d and 3d geometry for Computer Vision and Robotics applications. It is a spin-off of the Sophus C++ library which focuses on Lie groups (e.g. rotations and transformations in 2d and 3d)."
  - "In addition to Lie groups, sophus-rs also includes other geometric/maths concepts such unit vector, splines, image classes, camera models as well as a other utilities such as a non-linear least squares optimization."
