title: "cellular_raza: cellular agent-based modeling from a clean slate"
abstract:
  - "I will introduce the concept of Agent-Based Modeling in the context of biological systems and highlight some advancements and applications of our crate [`cellular_raza`](https://cellular-raza.com). Finally, I want to present some of my recent work in which I apply `cellular_raza` to the problem of Growth of Rod-Shaped bacteria such as E.Coli and Bacillus Subtilis."
