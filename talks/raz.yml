title: "Building a compile-time SIMD optimized smoothing filter"
abstract:
  - "I built a Savitzky-Golay filter (fancy name for a dot product with some known constants on a rolling window) and tried to optimize the crap out of it. It's fast, it was fun, and I want to share the tools that helped me see where I was missing perf like `cargo show asm`, `cargo remark` and `divan`."
