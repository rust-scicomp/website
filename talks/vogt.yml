title: "Representing open quantum systems in Rust"
abstract: "We are pursuing the goal of using near-term quantum computers to simulate open quantum systems using a Rust toolchain. To this end, we need to have a way to represent quantum systems (Hamiltonians and general quantum operators) and open quantum systems (defined by the so called Lindblad equation). To represent and work with open quantum systems in Rust we have created the open-source crate [struqture](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/struqture). It is actively used in research (<ref title='A quantum algorithm for solving open system dynamics on quantum computers using noise' author='Juha Lepp&auml;kangas, Nicolas Vogt, Keith R. Fratus, Kirsten Bark, Jesse A. Vaitkus, Pascal Stadler, Jan-Michael Reiner, Sebastian Zanker, and Michael Marthaler' arxiv='2210.12138' year='2022'> and <ref arxiv='2210.11371' author='Keith R. Fratus, Kirsten Bark, Nicolas Vogt, Juha Lepp&auml;kangas, Sebastian Zanker, Michael Marthaler, and Jan-Michael Reiner' title='Describing Trotterized time evolutions on noisy quantum computers via static effective Lindbladians' year='2022'>). In this short talk we give a quick introduction into the functionality struqture offers and present some of the main design goals of the package."
