title: "Rust is RAD and this is why"
abstract:
  - "As a scientist and a writer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we joined forces to create ACORN, Accessible Content Optimization for Research Needs, a command line multitool built in Rust to create analysis-ready research activity data. ACORN employs a set of automated processes for informing and/or enforcing defined content schemas to create standardized research activity data (RAD). Our goal is to use ACORN to help answer the question, \"What science are we doing at ORNL?\""
  - "In this session, we will discuss how Rust has enabled us to create a portable command line application to structure and standardize RAD. Doing this creates analysis-ready data intended to be used for knowledge graphs, scientific querying, and streamlining activities at a federally funded research and development center."
