title: "Bernstein&ndash;B&eacute;zier finite elements for RMM in Rust"
abstract: "The relaxed micromorphic model is briefly introduced. The model is well-posed in the spaces \\(H^1(V)\\times H(\\operatorname{curl}, V)\\). We construct Bernstein&ndash;B&eacute;zier and N&eacute;d&eacute;lec finite elements for the discretisation. The implementation is carried out in Rust, is vectorised using intrinsics, and parallelised using the Rayon library. An interface to Python is implemented via PyO3."
