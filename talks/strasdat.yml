title: "sophus-rs"
abstract:
  - "sophus-rs is a Rust library for 2d and 3d geometry for Computer Vision and Robotics applications. It is a spin-off of the Sophus C++ library which focuses on Lie groups (e.g. rotations and transformations in 2d and 3d)."
  - "In addition to Lie groups, sophus-rs also includes other geometric/maths concepts such unit vector, splines, image classes, camera models as well as a other utilities such as a non-linear least squares optimization."
  - "==="
  - "There is a lot of potential topics, but I'd like would spend most focus on efficient a non-linear least squares optimization - since this is closest to wider applications and more high-level, while being build on top of there concepts in the library (lie groups, dual numbers, camera models etc.)."
