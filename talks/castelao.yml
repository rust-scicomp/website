title: "Equation of state for robust oceanographic embedded systems"
abstract: "To support oceanographic autonomous platforms, Gibbs Sea Water library was implemented in Rust ([GSW-rs](https://github.com/castelao/GSW-rs)) and ready for embedded systems. Such library is a fundamental component to make sense of raw sensors measurements on real-time, thus allowing further autonomous decisions."
