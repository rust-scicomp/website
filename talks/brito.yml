title: "A parallel Lattice&ndash;Boltzmann CFD solver using rayon"
abstract: "This talk demonstrates a parallel Lattice&ndash;Boltzmann solver for computational fluid dynamics written in Rust using the Rust [rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/) library. Rayon is a data-parallelism library for Rust that guarantees data-race freedom and makes it easy to convert a sequential computation into a parallel one by using parallel iterators. The talk demonstrates how to use rayon to parallelize scientific PDE solvers, using the Lattice&ndash;Boltzmann method as an example."
