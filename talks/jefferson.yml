title: "Writing maths software in Rust after 20 years of C++: graph isomorphism and groups"
abstract:
  - "Group theory is a huge area of maths, featuring a wide range of algorithms. The most famous group theory algorithms is graph isomorphism, which finds if two graphs (represented as nodes and edges) are equivalent up to renaming the nodes."
  - "After writing logic algorithms in C and C++ for over 20 years, I decided to implement a new group theory algorithm I was working on in Rust, in a new program called 'Vole'. This tool implements high-performance group algorithms, and integrates with GAP, a mathematical language written in C."
