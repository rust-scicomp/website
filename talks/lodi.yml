title: "Roqoqo: a quantum computing toolkit in Rust"
abstract: "In this short talk we present [Roqoqo](https://docs.rs/roqoqo/latest/roqoqo/), an open-sourced quantum computing toolkit written in Rust. The package provides a comprehensive set of features and interfaces for representing, serializing and processing quantum circuits. It is actively used in research (<ref arxiv='2210.12138' author='Juha Lepp&auml;kangas, Nicolas Vogt, Keith R. Fratus, Kirsten Bark, Jesse A. Vaitkus, Pascal Stadler, Jan-Michael Reiner, Sebastian Zanker, Michael Marthaler' title='A quantum algorithm for solving open system dynamics on quantum computers using noise' year='2022'> and <ref arxiv='2210.11371' author='Keith R. Fratus, Kirsten Bark, Nicolas Vogt, Juha Lepp&auml;kangas, Sebastian Zanker, Michael Marthaler, Jan-Michael Reiner' title='Describing Trotterized time evolutions on noisy quantum computers via static effective Lindbladians' year='2022'>). During the talk we will give a quick introduction to the main functionalities that the package offers as well as present its main design goals."
