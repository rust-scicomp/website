  name: Andreas Longva
  about: Andreas is a PhD candidate in the computer animation group at RWTH Aachen University.
  rust-about: He has been writing scientific Rust since 2016, and since 2019 has been using Rust as the primary language for his research on finite element methods for deformable objects. As a co-maintainer of the [nalgebra linear algebra library](https://nalgebra.org/), he tries to squeeze in time for advancing the scientific ecosystem whenever he can.
