# Scientific Computing in Rust

Welcome to Scientific Computing in Rust. On this website, you'll find information about the Scientific Computing in Rust annual workshop and
monthly newsletter.

## Annual workshop

The Scientific Computing in Rust annual workshop is a virtual event focussing on the use of the Rust programming language
within scientific computing. Topics covered in past workshops have included linear algebra libraries,
running code on GPUs, and a huge range of application-specific libraries.
It was first held in [2023](/2023). Recordings of the talks for every workshop are available on the
[Scientific Computing in Rust YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificComputinginRust).

More information about the most recent workshop can be found on the <a href='/2024'>Scientific Computing in Rust 2024 workshop page</a>.

## Monthly newsletter

The Scientific Computing in Rust monthly newsletter features the latest updates related to using the Rust programming language
within scientific computing, including crate releases, upcoming events, publications, and jobs.
You can read the newsletter online or subscribe to receive it by email on the <a href='/monthly'>Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly page</a>
