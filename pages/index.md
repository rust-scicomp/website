# Scientific Computing in Rust 2024

Scientific Computing in Rust is a virtual workshop focussing on the use of the Rust programming language
within scientific computing. Topics covered in past workshops have included linear algebra libraries,
running code on GPUs, and a huge range of application-specific libraries.
 It was first held in [2023](/2023).
Recordings of the talks for every workshop are available on the
[Scientific Computing in Rust YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificComputinginRust).


The Scientific Computing in Rust 2024 workshop will take place on Wednesday 17 July to Friday 19
July between <a href='javascript:toggle_times()'>13:00 BST and 17:00 BST</a>.
This will be the second Scientific Computing in Rust workshop; archived information about
Scientific Computing in Rust 2023 can be found at [scientificcomputing.rs/2023](/2023).

## Registration
You can register to attend the Scientific Computing in Rust 2024 workshop using [the form on the registration page](/register).
Registration is free, and the workshop will take place virtually so there is no need to book travel or accomodation.

## Proposing a talk
The Scientific Computing in Rust 2024 workshop will feature a mixture of 30 minute talks by invited
speakers and 10 minute talks by workshop attendees, as well as some interactive discussion/tutorial sessions.

If you would like to propose a 10 minute talk, you can do so via [the form on talk proposal page](/submit-talk).
The deadline for talk submissions is Friday 21 June (extended from 14 June).

If you have any questions for the organisers (about proposing a talk or anything else), you can email
[contact@scientificcomputing.rs](mailto:contact@scientificcomputing.rs), or you can ask in the [rust-scicomp Zulip chat](https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/).
