# Scientific Computing in Rust 2024

Scientific Computing in Rust is a virtual workshop focussing on the use of the Rust programming language
within scientific computing. Topics covered in past workshops have included linear algebra libraries,
running code on GPUs, and a huge range of application-specific libraries.
It was first held in [2023](/2023).
Recordings of the talks for every workshop are available on the
[Scientific Computing in Rust YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificComputinginRust).
