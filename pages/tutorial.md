# Tutorials

Show times in: <timeselector>

From <time Thursday 15:30> on Thursday 18 July, there will be a tutorial session.
During this session, there will be a number of tutorials running in parallel for you to choose
from.

We are currently still finalising the list of available tutorials, but a provisional list is
available below.

<h2 style='margin-bottom:0px'>A beginner's gude to Rust</h2>
<h3 style='margin-top:0px'>Ignacia Fierro Piccardo and Matthew Scroggs</h3>

This session is aimed at people who don't use Rust yet, but are attending the workshop as they
are interested in starting to use it. We will cover basic syntax in Rust and a few of the language's
nicest features.

Before this session, please install Rust on your computer. There are instructions for doing
this at [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

<h2 style='margin-bottom:0px'>RLST: Matrices and linear algebra in Rust</h2>
<h3 style='margin-top:0px'>Timo Betcke</h3>

Over the last year we have developed RLST, the Rust Linear Solver Toolbox. It contains a number of data-structures, algorithms, and interfaces
to external solvers to support the discretisation and solution of partial differential equations in Rust.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use many of the features of RLST

<h2 style='margin-bottom:0px'>Symbolica: Symbolic algebra in Rust</h2>
<h3 style='margin-top:0px'>Ben Ruijl</h3>

In this tutorial we will explore the main features of the computer algebra crate [Symbolica](https://crates.io/crates/symbolica), which
include manipulating mathematical expressions, pattern matching, polynomial arithmetic, numerical evaluations and numerical
integration.
