This session is aimed at people who don't use Rust yet, but are attending the workshop as they
are interested in starting to use it. We will cover basic syntax in Rust and a few of the language's
nicest features.

Before this session, please install Rust on your computer. There are instructions for doing
this at [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
