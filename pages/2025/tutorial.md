This session is aimed at people who don't use Rust yet, but are attending the workshop as they
are interested in starting to use it. We will cover basic syntax in Rust and a few of the language's
nicest features.

Before this session, please install Rust on your computer. There are instructions for doing
this at [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

This session will walk you through the steps of using Rust to offload to accelerators using NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
This includes using cargo to integrate cmake or other C build systems into the build process. The end goal will
be to run a core benchmark commonly used in HPC and compare it to native C/CUDA/HIP performance.

In order to join in with the practical parts of this tutorial, you will need access to a machine with NVIDIA and/or AMD GPUs.
