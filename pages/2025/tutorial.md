Show times in: <timeselector>

From <time Thursday 15:00> on Thursday 5 June, there will be a tutorial session.
During this session, there will be a number of tutorials running in parallel for you to choose
from. The list of currently available tutorials is given below, with more tutorials expected to be added
in the coming weeks.

<h2 style='margin-bottom:0px'>A beginner's guide to Rust</h2>
<h3 style='margin-top:0px'>Ignacia Fierro Piccardo and Matthew Scroggs (University College London)</h3>

This session is aimed at people who don't use Rust yet, but are attending the workshop as they
are interested in starting to use it. We will cover basic syntax in Rust and a few of the language's
nicest features.

Before this session, please install Rust on your computer. There are instructions for doing
this at [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

<h2 style='margin-bottom:0px'>Integrating GPUs into Rust</h2>
<h3 style='margin-top:0px'>Brett Eiffert and Jeffrey S Vetter (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)</h3>

This session will walk you through the steps of using Rust to offload to accelerators using NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
This includes using cargo to integrate cmake or other C build systems into the build process. The end goal will
be to run a core benchmark commonly used in HPC and compare it to native C/CUDA/HIP performance.

In order to join in with the practical parts of this tutorial, you will need access to a machine with NVIDIA and/or AMD GPUs.
