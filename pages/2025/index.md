# Scientific Computing in Rust 2025

Scientific Computing in Rust is a virtual workshop focussing on the use of the Rust programming language
within scientific computing. Topics covered in past workshops have included linear algebra libraries,
running code on GPUs, and a huge range of application-specific libraries.
It was first held in [2023](/2023).
Recordings of the talks for every workshop are available on the
[Scientific Computing in Rust YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificComputinginRust).

The Scientific Computing in Rust 2025 workshop will take place on Wednesday 4 June to Friday 6
June between <a href='javascript:toggle_times()'>13:00 BST and 17:00 BST</a>.
This will the third Scientific Computing in Rust workshop; archived information about
Scientific Computing in Rust 2023 and 2024 can be found at

The workshop will be held virtually and will be free to attend. Recordings of the talks
from the workshop will be made available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificComputinginRust),
alongside the talks from 2023 and 2024.

## Registration
You can register to attend the Scientific Computing in Rust 2025 workshop using [the form on the registration page](/2025/register).
Registration is free, and the workshop will take place virtually so there is no need to book travel or accommodation.

## Proposing a talk
The Scientific Computing in Rust 2024 workshop will feature a mixture of 30 minute talks by invited
speakers, 10 minute talks by workshop attendees, and interactive discussion/tutorial sessions.

If you would like to propose a 10 minute talk or an interactive tutorial, you can do so via [the forms on talk proposal page](/2025/submit-talk).
The deadline for submissions is Friday 2 May.

If you have any questions for the organisers (about proposing a talk or anything else), you can email
[contact@scientificcomputing.rs](mailto:contact@scientificcomputing.rs), or you can ask in the [rust-scicomp Zulip chat](https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/).
