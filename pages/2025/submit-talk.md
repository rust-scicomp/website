# Talk proposal

The Scientific Computing in Rust 2025 workshop will feature a mixture of 30 minute talks by invited
speakers, 10 minute talks by workshop attendees, and interactive discussion/tutorial sessions.

Talk submissions are now closed. You can use the form below to a tutorial session.
Submissions of tutorials will remain open until 30 May, with submissions being accepted periodically.

Each attendee may only give one 10 minute talk, but attendees may give a 10 minute talk and run a tutorial if they wish to.
